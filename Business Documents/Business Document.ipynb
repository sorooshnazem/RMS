    "\n",
    "A **Point of Sale (POS)** is the system where a customer makes a payment for goods or services. In a restaurant, it‚Äôs where orders are entered, bills are generated, and payments are processed. Modern POS systems also act as a **central hub for operational data**.\n",

    "* Customize orders (e.g., no onions, extra cheese).\n",
    "* Send orders directly to the kitchen (via KDS or printer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Billing and Payments**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate receipts (paper or digital).\n",
    "* Accept various payments: cash, card, digital wallets.\n",

Project Overview\\nThis project is a **Restaurant Management System (RMS)** deployed on **Microsoft Azure**. It is composed of two main components:\\n\\n- **POS (Point of Sale)**  \\n  Manages customer interactions such as orders, payments, and menu browsing. This is the staff-facing side of the system.\\n\\n- **Management Portal**  \\n  Provides dashboards and reports for restaurant owners/managers. Enables tracking of sales, inventory, and overall business performance.\\n\\nBoth components are implemented as Python web applications (`app.py`) and run locally using:\\n``bash\\npython app.py\\n`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Folder Structure\\n`plaintext\\nproject-root/\\n‚îÇ\\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS/                   # Point of Sale system (staff & customer-facing)\\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py             # Main POS web application\\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/            # CSS, JS, images\\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # HTML templates\\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                # POS-related modules (orders, customers)\\n‚îÇ\\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ management\\_portal/     # Owner/Manager dashboards\\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py             # Main dashboard web application\\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/            # CSS, JS, images\\n    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # Dashboard HTML templates\\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                # Modules for analytics, reports, charts\\n``\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Azure Architecture\\n\\n### Services Used\\n- **Azure SQL Database** ‚Üí Stores structured data (customers, orders, inventory).\\n- **Azure App Service** ‚Üí Hosts the POS and Management Portal apps.\\n- **Azure Key Vault** ‚Üí Secures database connection strings and sensitive secrets.\\n- **Azure Data Factory** ‚Üí ETL pipelines for analytics.\\n- **Azure Service Bus** ‚Üí Event-driven communication between POS and backend systems.\\n- **Power BI** (planned integration) ‚Üí Business intelligence dashboards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Database Design (High-Level)\\n\\nEntities currently modeled:\\n- `Users` ‚Üí staff, owners, customers\\n- `Orders` & `Order_Items` ‚Üí track customer orders\\n- `Menu_Items` ‚Üí available products\\n- `Inventory` & `Inventory_Transactions` ‚Üí stock levels and movements\\n- `Payments` ‚Üí records of customer transactions\\n\\nüìå An **ERD** (Entity Relationship Diagram) was generated to represent these entities and their relationships.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Security Considerations\\n- Passwords stored securely (hashed with **bcrypt/Argon2**).\\n- Secrets (DB connection strings, API keys) stored in **Azure Key Vault**.\\n- SQL Database encrypted at rest with **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**.\\n- Connections enforced over **TLS/SSL**.\\n- Authentication and authorization planned for both POS and Management Portal (future option: **Azure AD B2C**).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)\\n\\nA Terraform configuration has been created to provision the required Azure resources:\\n\\n- Resource Group\\n- Storage Account (for staging/logs)\\n- Key Vault (to store secrets)\\n- Azure SQL Server + Database (with firewall rules)\\n- App Service Plan + App Service (for web apps)\\n- Data Factory (for pipelines)\\n- Service Bus Namespace + Queue (for messaging)\\n\\n### Key Features:\\n- DB connection string securely stored in **Key Vault**.\\n- Example firewall rule for developer IP.\\n- Outputs for resource names and endpoints after deployment.\\n- Recommendations included for production hardening (Managed Identity, monitoring, private endpoints).\\n\\nüìÇ See Terraform file for implementation details.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Next Steps\\n- Containerize both apps (Docker) for deployment to App Service or AKS.\\n- Implement CI/CD pipeline (Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions).\\n- Add **Application Insights** for monitoring.\\n- Integrate **Power BI Embedded** into the management portal.\\n- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for staff vs managers vs admin.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Notes\\n- Power BI provisioning is separate (handled via service principals or embedding APIs).\\n- For production: enable **purge protection** in Key Vault, use **private endpoints** for SQL and Storage.\\n- Sensitive variables should be stored in `terraform.tfvars` or pipeline secrets.\\n\\n``\"}]}\n"
